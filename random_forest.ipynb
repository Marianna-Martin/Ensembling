    "Random Forest is a versatile and powerful ensemble learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks in machine learning. It's an extension of decision tree algorithms that builds multiple decision trees during training and outputs the class that is the mode of the classes (classification) or the mean prediction (regression) of the individual trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how Random Forest works:\n",
    "\n",
    "Bootstrap Sampling (Bagging):\n",
    "\n",
    "Random Forest starts by creating multiple bootstrap samples (random samples with replacement) from the original training dataset.\n",
    "Each bootstrap sample has the same size as the original dataset but may contain duplicate instances and omit others.\n",
    "Random Feature Selection:\n",
    "\n",
    "For each decision tree in the Random Forest, a random subset of features is selected at each split.\n",
    "The number of features considered at each split is typically set to the square root of the total number of features.\n",
    "Decision Tree Training:\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple decision trees are trained independently on the bootstrap samples with the randomly selected features.\n",
    "Each decision tree is trained using the CART (Classification and Regression Trees) algorithm, which recursively splits the data at each node based on the feature that best separates the data into purest subsets.\n",
    "Prediction Aggregation:\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification tasks, the final prediction is determined by majority voting: the class that receives the most votes from the individual trees is chosen as the predicted class.\n",
    "For regression tasks, the final prediction is the average (or median) prediction of all individual trees."
